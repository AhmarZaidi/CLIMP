This project can be used to play, pause and replay mp3 files of constant bitrate from terminal.

It uses mciSendStringA() function of Windows Multimedia API (winmm.dll) to play mp3 files.

It is restricted to 9 songs in the 'Song List'. If more mp3s are present in the songs folder it will only take first 9.

Skips mp3s which could not be played.

UI is made manually instead of using libraries like ncurces etc. since it was a college project ðŸ™‚.

**How To Use**
1. Place constant bitrate mp3 files in the 'songs' folder which is in the same directory as the main.cpp file (up to 9 mp3s are supported).
   Song filename must follow this convention : <atristname>-<songname>-<duration>.mp3              example - OzzyOsbourne-Dreamer-4.44.mp3
   
2. winmm.dll (dynamic library) must be linked to main.cpp. This could be done in different ways in different IDEs or text editors.
   For Visual Studio Code Use - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71930390/120261277-35a7f180-c2b5-11eb-91c4-118d5c433c62.png)
   Note the addition of '-lwinmm' in this line. 

3. run main.cpp.


**Working Environment**
C++ standard 11 or newer (could work on older versions, not tested)
Operating System â€“ Windows XP(SP1 64 bit) or newer.
C++ Compiler â€“ MinGW gcc x64 (could work on others, not tested)
Note - terminal should accept ANSI Escape Sequences for the UI to work. (example - Windows Powershell)
